# The Conveyer - Quick Play Guide

## Scenario Overview

A tense battle on a descending platform through the underhive. Defenders must
hold the platform for 9 rounds while attackers try to eliminate them. Both sides
can secure valuable loot caskets, but staying off the platform risks being left
behind when it descends to the next level!

## Setup (Auto-Generated)

When you select "The Conveyer" scenario and click "New Battle":

1. **Central Platform** appears (marked with [PLATFORM] in descriptions)
   - ~12 cell radius circular area in center of map
   - Defenders start HERE

2. **10 Defenders (G)** deploy ON the platform
   - Cyan colored units
   - Safe zone initially

3. **10 Attackers (M)** deploy 16+ cells from platform
   - Red colored units
   - Must fight their way to platform

4. **4 Loot Caskets (◆)** placed around platform
   - White diamond symbols
   - Within 3-12 cells of platform edge

## Core Mechanic: Platform Movement

### Each End Phase:

1. Platform stability roll: **D6 + cumulative bonus**
2. Bonus = +1 for each round platform has been stationary
3. **On 6+, platform DESCENDS!**

### Example Timeline:

- **Round 1**: Roll D6 + 0 = need 6 (16% chance)
- **Round 2**: Roll D6 + 1 = need 5+ (33% chance)
- **Round 3**: Roll D6 + 2 = need 4+ (50% chance)
- **Round 4**: Roll D6 + 3 = need 3+ (66% chance)
- **Round 5**: Roll D6 + 4 = need 2+ (83% chance)
- **Round 6**: Automatic descent (D6 + 5 always ≥ 6)

**Platform gets VERY unstable by Round 5!**

## What Happens When Platform Descends?

1. **Fighters OFF platform = LEFT BEHIND**
   - Removed from board temporarily
   - Lose all conditions (good and bad)
   - Don't count as Out of Action

2. **Loot Caskets ON platform = SECURED**
   - Defenders gain credits for these at end (D6x10 each)
   - Caskets left behind are lost

3. **New Level Generated**
   - Terrain regenerates around platform
   - Platform itself stays intact with units on it
   - 4 NEW loot caskets appear

4. **Attackers Redeploy**
   - Respawn within 12 cells of platform
   - Get another chance to assault

## Strategy Tips

### For Defenders:

✅ **Stay on platform** - Your primary goal is survival ✅ **Drag loot onto
platform** - Each casket = D6x10 credits ✅ **Hold the center** - Force
attackers to come to you ✅ **Watch the clock** - Only need to survive 9 rounds
⚠️ Don't chase attackers off platform - risk being left behind ⚠️ Platform gets
shakier each round - get loot early!

### For Attackers:

✅ **Rush the platform early** - Don't get left behind! ✅ **Time your
assault** - Hit hard when platform is about to move ✅ **Target defenders** -
Eliminate all = instant victory ✅ **Use redeployment** - Being left behind
gives you a fresh start ⚠️ Getting on platform = risk of being trapped with
defenders ⚠️ Don't focus on loot - killing defenders is your win condition

## Loot Casket Tactics

### Moving Loot:

- Walk units over loot caskets
- Manually "push" them onto platform (abstracted - just position nearby)
- **Caskets ON platform when it descends = secured by defenders**

### Value:

- Each casket = **D6x10 credits** to defender
- Could be 10-60 credits each!
- 4 caskets = potentially 40-240 credits total

### Risk/Reward:

**Defenders:**

- Leave platform to grab loot = risk being left behind
- Stay safe on platform = lose potential credits

**Attackers:**

- Grab loot to deny defenders = diverts attention
- Focus on combat = better chance to win
- Loot doesn't help attackers in this scenario!

## Victory Conditions

### Attacker Wins If:

- All defenders eliminated **before Round 9**
- Reward: **D3 Reputation**
- Bonus XP: +1 XP for any fighter on platform when it moved

### Defender Wins If:

- **Any defender alive after Round 9**
- Reward: **D3 Reputation + D6x10 credits per secured loot casket**
- Bonus XP: +1 XP for any fighter on platform at game end

## Gameplay Flow

### Rounds 1-3: Positioning Phase

- Defenders: Secure loot, fortify platform
- Attackers: Advance toward platform
- Platform: Low chance to move (but possible!)

### Rounds 4-6: Critical Phase

- Platform movement very likely
- Both sides must commit to being ON or OFF platform
- First level transition usually happens here

### Rounds 7-9: Endgame

- If defenders survive to here, they're close to victory
- Attackers must go all-in on elimination
- Platform may move again (resets to low chance after descent)

## Advanced Tactics

### "The Bait"

- Defenders place 1-2 fighters near loot OFF platform
- Tempts attackers to engage away from platform
- Those defenders must have exit plan before platform moves!

### "The Rush"

- Attackers sprint to platform early
- Forces defenders to fight or be overwhelmed
- Risk: Attackers might be ON platform when it moves (good position but
  dangerous)

### "The Stall"

- Defenders avoid combat, just hold platform
- Clock is their ally - just need to survive 9 rounds
- Attackers must force engagement

### "The Sacrifice"

- Attackers intentionally stay OFF platform
- When it moves, they redeploy fresh around new level
- Defenders split up by loot = easier to eliminate

## Example Play Session

**Round 1:**

- Defenders grab nearby loot, pull back to platform center
- Attackers advance, taking shots at long range
- End Phase: Roll 1 + 0 = 1 (platform holds)

**Round 2:**

- Close combat begins at platform edge
- Defender pulls loot casket onto platform
- End Phase: Roll 3 + 1 = 4 (platform holds, getting nervous)

**Round 3:**

- Heavy fighting, 2 attackers and 1 defender down
- Another casket secured by defenders
- End Phase: Roll 5 + 2 = 7 (PLATFORM DESCENDS!)
- 3 attackers left behind, 2 loot caskets secured

**Round 4 (New Level):**

- Terrain regenerates, new loot appears
- 3 attackers redeploy around platform
- 9 defenders still on platform with 2 secured caskets
- Round counter = +0 again (fresh platform)

**Rounds 5-9:**

- Continue until defenders eliminated OR Round 9 ends
- Defenders ahead with 2 secured caskets already
- Attackers need to eliminate 9 fighters in 6 rounds

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Defenders chasing attackers off platform** - Get left behind ❌ **Attackers
staying back** - Will just get left behind over and over ❌ **Ignoring round
count** - Defenders forget they just need to survive ❌ **Over-committing to
loot** - Both sides forget victory conditions ❌ **Not watching platform
stability** - Surprised when it moves

## Pro Tips

💡 **Track the bonus** - Write down platform stability bonus each round 💡
**Plan 2 rounds ahead** - When will platform LIKELY move? 💡 **Position before
descent** - Get where you want to be 1 round early 💡 **Loot is secondary** -
Nice bonus but not primary goal for either side 💡 **Use terrain** - New level =
new tactical opportunities

| 5     | 2+          | 83%    | Almost certain     |
